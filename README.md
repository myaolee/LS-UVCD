LS-UVCD is a large scale underwater video compression dataset.

To standardize the data, we cropped the original video into 512×512 video sequences for storage, which can be download from: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/myaolee/LS-UVCD/tree/main]


During the training of our proposedUVC-Net, we randomly cropped the video sequences into 256 × 256 patches to achieve data augmentation and to benefits the GPU memory.
