# LS-UVCD
LS-UVCD is a large scale underwater video compression dataset
During the training of our proposedUVC-Net, we randomly cropped the video sequences into 256 Ã— 256 patches to achieve data augmentation, which also benefits the GPU memory.
The LS-UVCD dataset used to train our UVC-Net can be downloaded at: https://pan.baidu.com/
